      <h3>How to I access the media associated with a book?</h3>
      <h4>Accessing media in a print edition</h4>
      <p>
        There are two ways for readers of the print edition of this book to access and play back a specific
        media example. The first is to type in a web browser the full address of the PURL associated with
        a specific media example, as listed in the front of the book.  Readers will be taken to a web page
        displaying that media example as well as a playlist of all of the media examples related to this book.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once readers have navigated to the Ethnomusicology Multimedia website, the second way to access
        media examples is by typing into the search field the unique six-digit PURL identifier located
        at the end of the full PURL address.
      </p>
      <h4>Accessing media in an electronic edition</h4>
      <p>
        Readers of the electronic edition of this book will simply click on the PURL address for each media example;
        this live link will take them directly to each media example on the Ethnomusicology Multimedia website.
        Readers will be required to electronically sign an end-users license agreement (EULA) the first time they attempt
        to access a media example on the Ethnomusicology Multimedia website.

      <h3>What are PURLs?</h3>
      <p>
        PURL stands for "persistent uniform resource locator," and points to the location of a specific audio, video,
        or still image media example on the Ethnomusicology Multimedia website, www.ethnomultimedia.org. Each of the audio,
        video, or still image media examples listed below is associated with specific passages in this book, and each
        example has been assigned a PURL.  Within the running text of the book, a "PURL number" in parentheses functions
        like a citation and immediately follows the text to which it refers, e.g., (PURL 3.1).  The numbers following the
        word "PURL" relate to the chapter in which the media example is found, and the number of PURLs contained in that
        chapter. For example, PURL 3.1 refers to the first media example found in chapter three; PURL 3.2 refers to the
        second media example found in chapter three, and so on.

      <p>
